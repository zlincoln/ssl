user registration p2 - screencast mandatory

Hi Fia,

Thanks for sharing your background and some wisdom with us.  Yes, the hardest part for me has always been talking about money.  I feel more confident hearing it's okay to ask for 50% up front as I'm now in a position where I feel I should be doing that.  I haven't yet run into issues with people paying, but all the same I see what you're saying about contracts.

I also picked up and overview of your development process, ADDIO - which stands for: Analyze, Design, Develop + Debug, Integrate + Test, and Optimize.  We'll be covering the first few steps in our assignments this week.  It's also good to know that the screencast is mandatory.

Looking forward to presenting my work to you, thanks for helping us get up to speed!
